The model justification goes here.

We want bookable resources to be dynamically added to the app, not hard-coded.
We need to internationalize descriptions, titles, and such things belonging to these resources.
We can use django-hvad if the following holds:
    We can manage without .annotate(), in_bulk(), reverse() and only().
    We can do without some admin things (see bottom of http://django-hvad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/public/admin.html)
