The rules
#########

1. For each resource (e.g. a specific football field) you can make two reservations.
   
   You are allowed one solid reservation that nobody can touch, this reservation is the one closest in the future. Your second reservation is a preliminary reservation. It can be overwritten by anybody, just as you can overwrite others' preliminary reservations. You can only overwrite a preleminary reservation with a solid reservation.

   When the time for your solid reservation has passed, your preliminary reservation automatically becomes solid. Unless somebody else has removed it, of course.

2. One reservation at a time, so no reserving both the volleyball field and a football field for 1pm on Saturday afternoon.

3. If you do not show up within 15 minutes of your reservation's starting time your reservation is no longer valid. At that point it is first come, first serve.

4. Be kind to each other.
